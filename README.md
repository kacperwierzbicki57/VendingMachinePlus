## 🚀 Features

- **Dual Operation Modes**  
  Seamlessly switch between ATM and Vending Machine functionality.

- **Multi-Currency Support**  
  Supports transactions in three different currencies with intelligent handling logic.

- **Intelligent User Interface**  
  Clear, guided workflows tailored to the selected operation mode.

## 🏧 ATM Functionality

The ATM module supports advanced withdrawal logic designed to optimize both user convenience and machine efficiency.

Key capabilities include:
- **Multi-Currency Withdrawals** (3 supported currencies)
- **Minimal Bill Count Mode**  
  Dispenses the smallest possible number of bills
- **Stock-Optimized Distribution**  
  Automatically adjusts dispensing based on current cash availability

This ensures reliable operation while maintaining efficient cash management.
